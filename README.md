# ionic-auth
Ionic App - Authentication and authorization that consumes Rails API.

## Overview
An exercise to learn the essentials of the ionic framework, specifically, user authentication and authorization. Based on an excellent tutorial found here: http://devdactic.com/user-auth-angularjs-ionic/. Also a continuation on learning the Angular. js framework. Important to note it is just an exercise and I am continuing to tweak the core implementation in other github repos. Nevertheless, it was a great tutorial to extend my learning. I've since revisted the concept of restricting route authentication through the data param on the route in the stateProvider, coupled with monitoring state change via stateChangeStart.
